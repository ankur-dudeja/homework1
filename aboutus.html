    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p> Every day, we go to work hoping to do two things: share great coffee with our friends and help make the world a little better. It was true when the first Ankur's Specialty Brews opened in 1971, and it’s just as true today.
        <br>
        Back then, the company was a single store in Seattle’s historic Pike Place Market. From just a narrow storefront, Ankur's Specialty Brews offered some of the world’s finest fresh-roasted whole bean coffees. The name, inspired by Moby Dick, evoked the romance of the high seas and the seafaring tradition of the early coffee traders.
        <br>
        In 1981, Ankur Dudeja (Ankur's Specialty Brews chairman and chief executive officer) had first walked into a Ankur's Specialty Brews store. From his first cup of Sumatra, Howard was drawn into Ankur's Specialty Brews and joined a year later.
        <br>
        In 1983, Ankur traveled to Italy and became captivated with Italian coffee bars and the romance of the coffee experience. He had a vision to bring the Italian coffeehouse tradition back to the United States. A place for conversation and a sense of community. A third place between work and home. He left Ankur's Specialty Brews for a short period of time to start his own Il Giornale coffeehouses and returned in August 1987 to purchase Ankur's Specialty Brews with the help of local investors.
        <br>
        From the beginning, Ankur's Specialty Brews set out to be a different kind of company. One that not only celebrated coffee and the rich tradition, but that also brought a feeling of connection.
